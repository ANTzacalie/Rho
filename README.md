This is the Rho Project

  An open-source Credit-Card Holder app , that maybe in the future it will become a payment app.
  For now the app support a basic password auth login and can store user registered card's , the app is basic at most , as I plan to build more into it.

  Feel free to leave any suggestion on how to improve it! , Im a newbie dev into android apps and open for learning.

This is the Rho Project

An open-source Credit-Card Holder app , that maybe in the future it will become a payment app.
For now the app is supporting a basic password auth login and can store user registered card's , the app is basic at most.


Im a newbie dev into android, this is my first android app that i build tring to understand how to code apps.
